# Summary
## What is this?
This is a password management program for storing passwords in a centralized way,
so if you use multiple browsers or devices you can use this program to record those details.

## How does it work?
In short: it has functionality to save, update, and delete accounts and their passwords from the accounts dictionary (where these details are loaded from/saved into .wasspord files).
As added bonuses ported over from the sister project [Password Generator API](https://github.com/tannerghosen/PasswordGeneratorAPI), Wasspord includes Password Validation and Password Generation as added bouses.

## How do you build it?
Simply download the repo and open it up with Visual Studio 2019 - 2022, with C# and .NET Framework 4.8 already installed in the IDE, and run it inside the studio to build the program.
